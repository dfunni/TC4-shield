README.txt for /svn/applications/util/EEPROM

Sketches in this folder can be used to initialize, read, or test
the 64K EEPROM on the TC4 shield.

Many applications for the TC4 expect to find calibration information
in the EEPROM.  Use the writeCal sketch to initialize the EEPROM to
either a set of default values, or to a set of values determined
through calibration tests.
