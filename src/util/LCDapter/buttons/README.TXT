This sketch is designed to test the operation of the LCD display, buttons, and
LED's on the LCDapter board.

The two leftmost buttons control an up/down counter that is linked to the 3
LED's.

The two rightmost buttons control a second up/down counter.  This second
counter is not linked to the LED's.
